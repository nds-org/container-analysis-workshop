# Container Analysis Environment Workshop

This repository is intended to capture information from the 2017 Container Analysis Workshop hosted by NDS and the [Data Exploration Lab](https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/). The idea of the workshop emerged from the [7th NDS Workshop](http://www.nationaldataservice.org/get_involved/events/NDS7/) as an opportunity for groups leveraging container-based environments in research computing environments to share information and address common challenges.

We are proposing the following themes:
* Users/researchers and what they are using container-based environments for (e.g., consistent environments, packaging applications, shifting computation around)
* Interactive vs non-interactive use cases including approaches to workflow management, orchestration, and moving analysis to HPC environments.
* Data/storage focusing on models for managing and exposing data to containers.
* Challenges: what new use cases are we seeing?

The goal will be to approach this from both the user and systems perspectices, focusing on the science/research cases and how technical solutions are addressing these needs.

##  Participating organizations/projects
* [SciServer](sciserver.org)
* [Cyverse](http://www.cyverse.org/)
* [Whole Tale](http://wholetale.org/)
* [TERRA-REF](terraref.org)
* [Blue Waters](https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/)
* [Data Exploration Lab](https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/)
* [National Data Service](http://www.nationaldataservice.org/)


##  Format:

The format of the workshop will be presentations (8/15) mixed with discussions and working groups.  The working groups will be self-organized, based on the goals and needs of participants. Each person/group will present for ~20 minutes.  Participants will be from a variety of backgrounds.  Presentations should cover supported science cases, overall systems architecture, and any challenges/new directions related to supporting container-based analysis and computing environments.
